## Overview

The task was to create a Fullstack Warehouse Inventory Management app.

### The challenges

- The challenge was to make Backend Frontend and also Database where I can do CRUD(Create, Read, Update, Delete) operation.
- For frontend challenging part was to create functioning authentication system.
- Besides there are a lot of routes I need to work with and sometimes it was challenging to maintain.
- But overall it was a fun project. I really enjoyed.

### How it works

- Wheel Wave is a 3rd Party cycle supplier who sells cycle of other companies. So this homepage was mainly for suppliers.
- Supplier can see all the products including competitors and also they can supply competitor's product as well. Let's assume it's a good world and nobody harms other.
- If a supplier deliver a product from his or other company's he can update the quantity of the product by clicking delivered.
- In the Navbar if someone is not logged in he can see Products Catalog menu but if he loggedin then he can see manage inventory menu.
- When someone hits delivered, the the quantity will be reduced and sold value will be increased. For this, supplier must be logged in.
- Beside if a supplier wants to restock the product, he can use the little input field and hit restock button. For this, supplier must be logged in.
- A supplier can delete only his product and also if he wants to he can add new product by clicking Add New Product on the manage inventory page.
- After loggedin there will be a dropdown menu in the area where his name is displayed. By using dropdown menu supplier can see many other options.
- If someone is a writer, he can express difference experience by hitting add new blog on the blogs route.
- Now about authentication, user can sign in using existing email password or using social media link.
- One can also signup with new information, and after sign up a Email verfication link will be sent to his/ her email.
- If anyone forgets the password, he can always reset the password.
